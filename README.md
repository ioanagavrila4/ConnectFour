# 🟡🔴 Connect Four – Python 

A simple terminal-based implementation of the classic **Connect Four** game using Python. Play against another human in a two-player mode, right from your terminal!

## 🎮 Game Features

- Two-player mode (human vs. human)
- Board display using ASCII characters
- Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Input validation

## 🧱 How It Works

The board is a 6-row by 7-column grid. Players take turns dropping their discs (`🔴` or `🟡`) into the columns. The first to align four discs in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — wins the game!
